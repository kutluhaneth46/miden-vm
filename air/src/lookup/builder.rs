//! Closure-based traits for emitting LogUp lookup interactions.
//!
//! The trait stack sits on top of [`LookupAir`](super::LookupAir):
//!
//! - [`LookupBuilder`] — the top-level handle mirroring the subset of `LiftedAirBuilder` a lookup
//!   author actually needs (trace access plus per-column scoping). It hides `assert_*` / `when_*` /
//!   permutation plumbing and does not expose the verifier challenges.
//! - [`LookupColumn`] — per-column handle returned by [`LookupBuilder::next_column`]. It owns the
//!   boundary between groups; its only job is to open a group (either the simple path or the
//!   cached-encoding dual path).
//! - [`LookupGroup`] — the simple, challenge-free interaction API used by bus authors. Every method
//!   here takes a `LookupMessage`; the enclosing adapter is responsible for encoding it under α + Σ
//!   βⁱ · payload.
//! - [`LookupBatch`] — a short-lived handle returned inside [`LookupGroup::batch`]. Represents a
//!   set of simultaneous interactions that share the outer group's flag.
//! - [`LookupGroup`] also exposes optional encoding primitives (`bus_prefix`, `beta_powers`,
//!   `insert_encoded`) for the cached-encoding path. Default implementations panic; only the
//!   constraint-path adapter overrides them with real bodies.
//!
//! No adapter impls live in this file; the bounds here are chosen so that both the
//! constraint-path adapter (which forwards to an inner `LiftedAirBuilder`, carrying
//! symbolic `AB::Expr` / `AB::ExprEF` associated types) and the prover-path adapter
//! (instantiated with the concrete `F` / `EF` field types) can satisfy them.

// DEGREE ANNOTATION
// ================================================================================================

/// Expected post-flag `(V, U)` contribution for one interaction or scope.
///
/// Every builder method takes a `Deg` so debug adapters can check declared degrees against the
/// symbolic expression they just accumulated. Production adapters ignore it.
///
/// - `v`: degree of the numerator (`V`) contribution after multiplying by the surrounding flag.
/// - `u`: degree of the denominator (`U`) contribution after multiplying by the surrounding flag.
///
/// Field order mirrors the `(V, U)` tuple convention used throughout the
/// adapter code: numerator first, denominator second.
///
/// ## Semantics by call site
///
/// - **Single interactions** ([`LookupGroup::add`], `remove`, `insert`, `insert_encoded`, and the
///   corresponding [`LookupBatch`] methods): `(v, u) = (deg(m) + deg(f), deg(D) + deg(f))`, where
///   `m` is the signed multiplicity, `D` is the denominator, and `f` is the gate. For batch
///   entries, `f` is the batch gate. These values describe the interaction itself; the batch fold
///   later multiplies its numerator by the other entries' denominators.
///
/// - **Batch outer** ([`LookupGroup::batch`]): the post-flag contribution the *whole* batch makes
///   to the enclosing group's `(V_g, U_g)` — `(deg(N) + deg(f), deg(D) + deg(f))` where `(N, D)` is
///   the running pair the inner-loop body accumulates and `f` is the batch flag. The pre-flag `(N,
///   D)` is mechanically derivable from the inner-loop body — `((k − 1) · d_v, k · d_v)` for `k`
///   interactions of inner denominator degree `d_v` — so it is documented inline at each batch site
///   rather than carried in the struct.
///
/// - **Group / column scope** ([`LookupColumn::group`], `group_with_cached_encoding`,
///   [`LookupBuilder::next_column`]): the total post-flag `(V, U)` contribution of the group /
///   column to the surrounding accumulator. Useful as a budget audit number when the author wants
///   to assert what the scope as a whole contributes.

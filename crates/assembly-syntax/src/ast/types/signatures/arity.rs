//! How much room a value takes, and what fits in it.
//!
//! [`felt_count`] and [`token_count`] are one walk over a type that adds up a number for each
//! leaf: the felts a value takes on the stack, and the argument tokens it needs. The walk lives
//! here, so arrays and structs always work the same way for both. Only the number for a leaf is
//! different.
//!
//! The rest is arithmetic on the width of a stack slot, which encode and decode both need to tell
//! a value that fits from one that does not.

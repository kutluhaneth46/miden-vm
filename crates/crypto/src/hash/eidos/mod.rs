//! The Eidos hash construction and its underlying compression function.
//!
//! [`Eidos`](crate::hash::eidos::Eidos) exposes a framed hash construction and a raw compression
//! operation. Complete-hash methods apply domain and length binding, framing, and padding.
//! [`Eidos::compress`](crate::hash::eidos::Eidos::compress) compresses one complete block under a
//! caller-supplied chaining value and adds no framing.
//!
//! Eidos digests occupy a 252-bit packed subspace: the high bit of each odd Eidos compression
//! output lane is cleared before two `u32` lanes are packed into one Goldilocks field element. The
//! resulting generic collision-resistance bound is 126 bits.

/// A compact representation of trees in a forest. Used in the Merkle forest (MMR).
///
/// Each active bit of the stored number represents a disjoint tree with number of leaves
/// equal to the bit position.
///
/// The forest value has the following interpretations:
/// - its value is the number of leaves in the forest
/// - the version number (MMR is append only so the number of leaves always increases)
/// - bit count corresponds to the number of trees (trees) in the forest
/// - each true bit position determines the depth of a tree in the forest
///
/// Examples:
/// - `Forest(0)` is a forest with no trees.
/// - `Forest(0b01)` is a forest with a single leaf/node (the smallest tree possible).
/// - `Forest(0b10)` is a forest with a single binary tree with 2 leaves (3 nodes).
/// - `Forest(0b11)` is a forest with two trees: one with 1 leaf (1 node), and one with 2 leaves (3
///   nodes).
/// - `Forest(0b1010)` is a forest with two trees: one with 8 leaves (15 nodes), one with 2 leaves
///   (3 nodes).
/// - `Forest(0b1000)` is a forest with one tree, which has 8 leaves (15 nodes).
///

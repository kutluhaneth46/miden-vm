//! FRI Verifier
//!
//! Verifies that a committed polynomial is close to low-degree.
//!
//! # Domain Structure
//!
//! The prover commits to evaluations on domain D of size 2^log_domain_size. The LMCS tree
//! is indexed by domain order (natural index). Internally, evaluations are in bit-reversed
//! order within the committed matrix (wrapped in `BitReversedMatrixView`).
//!
//! # Index Semantics
//!
//! The query `index` is a domain index. For each folding round:
//!   - Low bits (`index & (folded_size - 1)`): which row (coset) in the committed matrix
//!   - High bits (`index >> (log_domain_size - log_arity)`): position within the coset
//!
//! After each fold, we mask to the new folded domain size.

            //    the same coset share the same row and s_inv, so they fold to identical values.

//! 64-bit memory bus message.
//!
//! Inter-chiplet bus carrying tuples `(addr, lo, hi)` where:
//!
//! - `addr` is a felt-valued cell address.
//! - `lo, hi ∈ [0, 2^32)` are the 32-bit halves of a 64-bit cell value.
//!
//! Bus discipline: the LogUp bus balances *per* `(addr, lo, hi)` tuple
//! — each distinct encoded message is its own term in the running sum.
//! Two providers writing the same address with different values are
//! two independent bus entries.
//!
//! In the Keccak round chiplet, intra-permutation cells are used
//! single-assignment-style (one provide per IP at some multiplicity,
//! matching consumer reads). At permutation boundaries the sponge AIR
//! exploits the multiset semantics to overwrite state: consume
//! `(X, perm_N_out)` and provide `(X, perm_N_out ⊕ block)` at the
//! same `X`, two different bus entries each balancing independently.
//! See the design notes for the boundary tuple math.
//!
//! The `64` suffix anticipates future memory buses with different word
//! widths; this one carries 64-bit values.

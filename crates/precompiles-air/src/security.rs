//! Conjectured security level computation for the precompile chiplet stack.
//!
//! The chiplet stack proves a different statement from the VM's, with its own AIRs, bus width, and
//! PCS preset, so it needs its own shape — but the round budget itself is shared with the VM
//! through [`p3_security::budget`], and so are the challenge field and commitment hash.
//!
//! The AIR shape is stored as the constant [`AIR_SHAPE`] and guarded against drift by
//! `air_shape_matches_symbolic`, matching how the VM side does it.

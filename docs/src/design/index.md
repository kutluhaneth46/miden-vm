# Design
In the following sections, we provide in-depth descriptions of Miden VM internals, including all AIR constraints for the proving system. We also provide rationale for making specific design choices.

Throughout these sections we adopt the following notations and assumptions:
* All arithmetic operations, unless noted otherwise, are assumed to be in a prime field with modulus $p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$.
* A _binary_ value means a field element which is either $0$ or $1$.
* We use lowercase letters to refer to individual field elements (e.g., $a$), and uppercase letters to refer to groups of $4$ elements, also referred to as words (e.g., $A$). To refer to individual elements within a word, we use numerical subscripts. For example, $a_0$ is the first element of word $A$, $b_3$ is the last element of word $B$, etc.
* Unless a count is explicitly described as base-field coordinates, trace-column counts refer to
  columns over that AIR's native field. A quadratic-extension auxiliary column occupies two
  base-field coordinates in the recursive verifier's memory frame.
* When describing AIR constraints:
  - For a column $x$, we denote the value in the current row simply as $x$, and the value in the next row of the column as $x'$. Thus, all transition constraints for Miden VM work with two consecutive rows of the execution trace.
  - For multiset equality constraints, we denote random values sent by the verifier after the prover commits to the main execution trace as $\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2$ etc.
  - To differentiate constraints from other formulas, we frequently use the following format for constraint equations.

$$
x' - (x + y) = 0 \text{ | degree} = 1
$$

In the above, the constraint equation is followed by the implied algebraic degree of the constraint. This degree is determined by the number of multiplications between trace columns. If a constraint does not involve any multiplications between columns, its degree is $1$. If a constraint involves multiplication between two columns, its degree is $2$. If we need to multiply three columns together, the degree is $3$ ect.

The maximum allowed constraint degree in Miden VM is $9$. If a constraint degree grows beyond that, we frequently need to introduce additional columns to reduce the degree.

## VM components
Miden VM consists of several interconnected components, each providing a specific set of functionality. These components are:

* **System**, which is responsible for managing system data, including the current VM cycle (`clk`), and the current and parent execution contexts.
* **Program decoder**, which is responsible for computing a commitment to the executing program and converting the program into a sequence of operations executed by the VM.
* **Operand stack**, which is a push-down stack which provides operands for all operations executed by the VM.
* **Chiplets**, which is a set of specialized circuits used to accelerate commonly-used complex computations. Currently, the VM relies on 5 chiplets:
  - Hash controller, used with the standalone Eidos compression AIR to compute Eidos sequential,
    control-block, and Merkle hashes.
  - Bitwise chiplet, used to compute bitwise operations (e.g., `AND`, `XOR`) over 32-bit integers.
  - Memory chiplet, used to support random-access memory in the VM.
  - ACE chiplet, used to evaluate arithmetic circuits.
  - Kernel ROM chiplet, used to enable calling predefined kernel procedures which are provided before execution begins.
* **Eidos compression AIR**, which proves every 32-row compression requested by the hash
  controller.
* **And8 lookup AIR**, whose fixed byte-pair table supplies byte-AND, Eidos compression rotation, and
  [16-bit range-check](./range.md) relations.

The above components are connected via **buses**, which are implemented using [lookup arguments](./lookups/index.md). We also use [multiset check lookups](./lookups/multiset.md) internally within components to describe **virtual tables**.

## VM execution trace

Miden VM is a four-AIR statement: Core, Chiplets, Eidos compression, and And8 lookup. The
traditional combined row view of the Core and Chiplets matrices consists of $73$ main columns;
the compatibility layout reserves $9$ auxiliary LogUp columns. Eidos compression uses its own
108-column main matrix and $20$ auxiliary LogUp columns in each 32-row cycle, while And8 uses a fixed
65,536-row byte-pair table and dynamic multiplicity columns.

The system, decoder, and stack use dedicated columns, while all chiplets share the same $24$
columns. Binary selector columns identify which chiplet owns each row. Range-check requests do not
occupy a separate main-trace segment; their multiplicities are recorded in `And8LookupAir`.

The system component does not yet have a dedicated documentation section, since the design is likely to change. However, the following column is not expected to change:

* `clk` which is used to keep track of the current VM cycle. Values in this column start out at $0$ and are incremented by $1$ with each cycle.

For the `clk` column, the constraints are straightforward:

$$
clk' - (clk + 1) = 0 \text{ | degree} = 1
$$

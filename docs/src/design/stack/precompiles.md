# Precompiles

Precompiles let Miden programs make claims about expensive computations without executing them
directly in the VM trace, while still binding those claims into the VM proof. This page covers the
VM-side mechanics: wrappers register deferred nodes, bind their digests to circuit-visible data, and
log statement digests that evaluate to `TRUE`. `VmProof` authenticates the resulting root. Deferred
execution proofs transport passive wire; the [deferred-proof semantics](../deferred/semantics.md)
define hydration, proving, completion, and verification.

Concrete proof-bound implementations live in the `miden-precompiles` crate. Their MASM support
modules are currently internal implementation detail used by core-library facades and tests.

## Current data model

- **`Tag`** — A 4-felt node constructor. Framework ids `0`, `1`, and `2` are reserved for `TRUE`,
  semantic `AND`, and opaque framework `CHUNKS`. Precompile ids are derived from precompile names
  and interpret the remaining three `args` felts locally.
- **`Node`** — A content-addressed `(tag, payload)` term in the deferred DAG. Payloads are data
  chunks, join child digests, pair lists of `lhs_digest || rhs_digest` chunks, or the framework
  `TRUE` sentinel.
- **`Precompile`** — A host implementation that owns one precompile id and decodes the structural
  shape for its tags. It evaluates nodes to canonical form and optionally contributes constants
  through `init()`.
- **`PrecompileRegistry`** — The host/framework dispatcher for trusted precompile implementations.
  The type remains in `miden-core` so the framework does not depend on concrete implementations.
- **`DeferredState`** — The host-side DAG witness accumulated during execution. It tracks
  registered nodes, evaluates them under the registry, and maintains the rolling deferred root.
- **`DeferredStateWire`** — The passive canonical opening transported by a deferred execution proof.
  Proof decoding does not hydrate it. `miden_vm::precompile_witness_from_wire` explicitly applies
  the bundled registry and validates it when precompile proving is required.
- **Deferred root** — A single digest public value. Each logged statement appends
  `Node::AND(previous_root, statement_digest)` and advances the root to that node digest.

## Lifecycle overview

1. **Wrapper registers nodes** – Internal MASM support code stages node payloads on the operand
   stack or in memory and emits `adv.register_deferred` / `adv.register_deferred_data`.
   Registration stores the node in host-side `DeferredState`, checks structural child closure, and
   evaluates the node immediately under the installed registry.
2. **Wrapper binds digests inside the VM** – Registration arguments are visible in the VM
   execution trace, but the event does not constrain the host-side `DeferredState` update.
   Memory-backed registration also performs direct host reads without adding AIR accesses. The
   wrapper computes each proof-relevant digest with VM instructions from the exact same tag and
   stack payload or ordered memory chunk sequence.
3. **Wrapper evaluates only through explicit predicates** – When a wrapper uses
   `adv.evaluate_deferred*` to obtain host-computed canonical data, it must use VM instructions to
   relate that advice to values established independently of it, then log a statement digest that
   bundled hydration can re-evaluate before precompile proving.
4. **`log_deferred` folds a statement** – The opcode expects `STMNT` at stack offsets `4..8`.
   `STMNT` must already be registered in `DeferredState` and evaluate to `TRUE`. One constrained
   Eidos compression computes
   `ROOT_NEW = Eidos::compress(DEFERRED_AND_INIT_CV, ROOT_PREV || STMNT)`, and host-side
   deferred state records the corresponding `AND` node.

## Responsibilities

- **VM** — Executes deferred advice events and `log_deferred`, maintains the rolling deferred
  root, and exposes the final root as a public value.
- **Host / advice provider** — Maintains `DeferredState`, runs trusted precompile implementations,
  and supplies evaluation advice when wrappers request it.
- **MASM wrapper** — Registers concrete deferred nodes and computes node and statement digests
  with VM instructions from exact stack payloads or memory reads. It logs only statements that
  should evaluate to `TRUE`, and hides helper outputs from callers when appropriate.
Proving, verification, transport, and resource policy are specified in the
[deferred-proof semantics](../deferred/semantics.md).

## Conventions

- Tag layout: `TAG = [precompile_id, arg0, arg1, arg2]`.
  - `precompile_id` selects the framework or owning precompile.
  - `arg0..arg2` are interpreted by the selected precompile.
  - Framework id `0` is `Tag::TRUE`; framework id `1` is `Tag::AND`; framework id `2` is
    `Tag::CHUNKS`.
- Payload shapes are declared by the selected precompile's `decode(args)`, but semantic lengths are
  tag-specific and validated by the owning precompile:
  - `NodeType::Data` accepts one or more opaque 8-felt chunks. For memory-backed registration,
    the stack-supplied `n_chunks` determines how many chunks are read.
  - `NodeType::Join` reads `lhs_digest || rhs_digest`.
  - `NodeType::PairList` accepts one or more `lhs_digest || rhs_digest` chunks. Precompiles that
    encode a pair count in tag arguments must check the actual payload length during evaluation.
- `log_deferred` stack effect: `[_, STMNT, _, ...] -> [ROOT_NEW, STMNT, _, ...]` where `STMNT`
  occupies stack offsets `4..8`. Only the top word is replaced; wrappers usually drop all three
  temporary words after the root transition has been constrained.
- Input and memory layouts are precompile-specific. Core-library wrappers define the native formats
  for hash facades and for arithmetic/curve support used by signature verification.

## Examples

- Hash support wrappers register the input/result nodes needed for the hash claim and log a
  statement digest that verifies the claimed digest.
- Signature support wrappers register the public key, precompile-specific message input, signature,
  and verification predicate nodes, then log the predicate statement.

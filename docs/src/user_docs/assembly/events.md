## Events

Events interrupt VM execution for one cycle and hand control to the host. The host can read VM state and modify the advice provider. From the VM's perspective, `emit` has identical semantics to `noop` - the operand stack and registers remain unchanged.

Event identifiers are field elements derived from well-known strings using `EventId::from_name()` (first 64 bits of `blake3("<name>")` as little-endian u64, mod p). Defined system events are reserved and use names in the `sys::` namespace; their IDs are derived from those names with the same mapping. The VM doesn't enforce structure for stack-provided IDs, but immediate forms restrict inputs to this string-based mapping.

Event names should be as unique as possible to avoid collisions with other libraries. Use a hierarchical naming convention like `project_name::library_name::event_name`. Generic names may cause conflicts in multi-library environments.

### Event Instructions

- **`emit`** - Interrupts execution, hands control to host (1 cycle)
- **`emit.<event_id>`** - Expands to `push.<event_id> emit drop` (3 cycles). Immediate IDs must come from `event("...")` constants or inline `event("...")`.
- **`trace`** - Emits the trace ID at the top of the stack as an optional, read-only trace event without consuming it (3 cycles)
- **`trace.<trace_id>`** - Emits a stack-neutral trace event (5 cycles). Immediate IDs must come from `event("...")` constants or inline `trace.event("...")`.

```miden
# Using a constant
const MY_EVENT = event("miden::transfer::initiated")
emit.MY_EVENT

# Inline form
emit.event("miden::transfer::initiated")

# Equivalent manual stack form (any Felt – not validated):
push.<felt> emit drop
```

### Event Types

**System Events** - Built-in events handled by the VM for memory operations, cryptography, math operations, and data structures.

**Custom Events** - Application-defined events for external services, logging, or custom protocols. Custom handlers can be native Rust code registered in the host, or untrusted Wasm modules shipped inside a package; see [Wasm event handlers](../wasm_event_handlers.md).

### Trace Events (optional read-only events)

Trace events are a special class of optional, read-only events. Unlike regular custom events, they cannot mutate the advice provider, and a trace event with no registered handler is a no-op.

Use the `trace` instruction to emit a trace event. Like `emit`, the bare form reads an ID from the top of the stack without consuming it. The immediate forms accept IDs derived from event names, either through an `event("...")` constant or inline.

```miden
# Using a constant
const MY_TRACE = event("miden_debug::println")
trace.MY_TRACE

# Inline form
trace.event("miden_debug::println")

# Stack form (any Felt - not validated)
push.<felt>
trace
drop
```

The bare `trace` instruction takes 3 cycles and leaves the stack unchanged. `trace.MY_TRACE` and `trace.event("...")` are stack-neutral and take 5 cycles.

As an implementation detail, `trace.<trace_id>` lowers to `push.<trace_id> push.<sys::trace_event> emit drop drop`. Plain `trace` lowers to `push.<sys::trace_event> emit drop`. Thus, when the host trace handler runs, `sys::trace_event` is at stack position 0 and the user trace ID is at stack position 1.

On the Rust side, hosts can register trace handlers via `DefaultHost::register_trace_handler`, or implement `SyncHost::on_trace` / `Host::on_trace`. Hosts that do not implement `on_trace` still execute programs containing trace events: the default implementation is a no-op, and trace events are not routed to the regular `on_event` handler.

## Input / output operations

Miden assembly provides a set of instructions for moving data between the operand stack and several other sources. These sources include:

- **Program code**: values to be moved onto the operand stack can be hard-coded in a program's source code.
- **Environment**: values can be moved onto the operand stack from environment variables. These include current clock cycle, current stack depth, and a few others.
- **Advice provider**: values can be moved onto the operand stack from the advice provider by popping them from the advice stack (see more about the advice provider [here](../../overview.md#nondeterministic-inputs)). The VM can also inject new data into the advice provider via _system event_ instructions.
- **Memory**: values can be moved between the stack and random-access memory. The memory is element-addressable, meaning that a single element is located at each address. However, reading and writing elements to/from memory in batches of four is supported via the appropriate instructions (e.g. `mem_loadw_be` or `mem_storew_le`). Memory can be accessed via absolute memory references (i.e., via memory addresses) as well as via local procedure references (i.e., local index). The latter approach ensures that a procedure does not access locals of another procedure.

### Constant inputs

| Instruction                                                                     | Stack_input | Stack_output                                         | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| push._a_ <br /> - _(1-2 cycles)_ <br /> push._a_._b_ <br /> push._a_._b_._c_... | [ ... ]     | [a, ... ] <br /> [b, a, ... ] <br /> [c, b, a, ... ] | Pushes values $a$, $b$, $c$ etc. onto the stack. Up to $16$ values can be specified. All values must be valid field elements in decimal (e.g., $123$) or hexadecimal (e.g., $0x7b$) representation. |
| push.[_a_,_b_,_c_,_d_] <br /> - _(4 cycles)_                                     | [ ... ]     | [a, b, c, d, ... ]                                   | Pushes a word (4 field elements) onto the stack. The first element $a$ ends up on top of the stack. All values must be valid field elements in decimal or hexadecimal representation. |

The value can be specified in hexadecimal form without periods between individual values as long as it describes a full word ($4$ field elements or $32$ bytes). Note that hexadecimal values separated by periods (short hexadecimal strings) are assumed to be in big-endian order, while the strings specifying whole words (long hexadecimal strings) are assumed to be in little-endian order. That is, the following are semantically equivalent:

```
push.0x00001234.0x00005678.0x00009012.0x0000abcd
push.0x341200000000000078560000000000001290000000000000cdab000000000000
push.4660.22136.36882.43981
```

In both case the values must still encode valid field elements.

#### Sequential pushes and word literals

Dot-delimited values are pushed sequentially from left to right. A bracketed literal instead pushes one word in the listed order:

```masm
push.1.2.3.4      # [4, 3, 2, 1, ...]; equivalent to push.1 push.2 push.3 push.4
push.[1,2,3,4]    # [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]; equivalent to push.4 push.3 push.2 push.1
```

Stack diagrams list the top element first.

You can also use slices with word constants to push only a portion of the word:

```
const WORD = [5,6,7,8]

push.WORD[0]      # is equivalent to push.5
push.WORD[1..3]   # is equivalent to `push.7 push.6`
push.WORD[0..4]   # is equivalent to push.[5,6,7,8]
```

### Nondeterministic inputs

As mentioned above, nondeterministic inputs are provided to the VM via the advice provider. Instructs which access the advice provider fall into two categories. The first category consists of instructions which move data from the advice stack onto the operand stack and/or memory.

| Instruction                         | Stack_input        | Stack_output        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| adv_push <br /> - _(1 cycle)_ | [ ... ]            | [a, ... ]           | $a \leftarrow advstack.pop()$ <br /> Pops a single value from the advice stack and pushes it onto the operand stack. <br /> Fails if the advice stack is empty.                                                                                                               |
| adv_pushw <br /> - _(5 cycles)_ | [ ... ]            | [A, ... ]           | Equivalent to `padw adv_loadw`. <br /> Pushes a word (4 elements) from the advice stack onto the operand stack (grows stack by 4). <br /> Fails if the advice stack has fewer than $4$ values.                                                                                                               |
| adv_loadw <br /> - _(1 cycle)_     | [0, 0, 0, 0, ... ] | [A, ... ]           | $A \leftarrow advstack.pop(4)$ <br /> Pop the next word (4 elements) from the advice stack and overwrites the first word of the operand stack (4 elements) with them. <br /> Fails if the advice stack has fewer than $4$ values.                                                                                              |
| adv_pipe <br /> - _(1 cycle)_      | [A, B, C, a, ... ] | [A', B', C, a+8, ... ] | Pops two words $A', B'$ from the advice stack. Overwrites the top two words of the operand stack (positions 0-7) with them. The third word $C$ (positions 8-11) is unchanged. Writes both words to memory at addresses $a$ and $a + 4$, then increments $a$ by 8. <br /> Fails if the advice stack has fewer than $8$ values. |

> **Note**: When using multiple sequential `adv_push` instructions (e.g., `repeat.n adv_push end`), data is pushed so that the first element is placed deepest in the stack. For example, if the advice stack contains `a,b,c,d` and you use `repeat.4 adv_push end`, the operand stack will be `d,c,b,a`.

The second category injects new data into the advice provider or updates host-side deferred state. These operations are called _system events_. They do not directly change ordinary VM state such as the operand stack or memory. Handling system events uses the same mechanism as standard events using `emit` (i.e., these instructions are executed in $3$ cycles). Defined system events are reserved, use names in the `sys::` namespace, and are dispatched by the VM, while user-defined events use string-based `EventId::from_name()` derivation with unique, descriptive names following hierarchical naming conventions to avoid conflicts.

System events can push data onto the advice stack, insert data into the advice map, or update host-side deferred state. One exception is `sys::trace_event`: it is a non-mutating system event used only to signal optional, read-only trace events to the host. See the [events documentation](./events.md#trace-events-optional-read-only-events) for details.

For deferred DAG instructions, `TAG` and every digest are one word (4 field elements), while one
data chunk is 8 field elements (two words).

Registration interprets payloads by the decoded tag shape:

- `adv.register_deferred` reads one stack-resident payload block from `PAYLOAD_LO || PAYLOAD_HI`:
  - data tags interpret it as one data chunk;
  - join tags interpret it as `lhs_digest || rhs_digest`;
  - pair-list tags interpret it as one `lhs_digest || rhs_digest` pair.
- `adv.register_deferred_data` reads exactly `n_chunks` blocks from word-aligned `ptr`:
  - data tags interpret them as opaque data chunks;
  - pair-list tags interpret them as `lhs_digest || rhs_digest` pairs;
  - join tags require `n_chunks == 1` and interpret the chunk as `lhs_digest || rhs_digest`.

The register arguments are visible in the VM execution trace, but the event does not constrain the
host-side registration. `adv.register_deferred_data` additionally performs direct host reads without
adding AIR memory accesses. Neither register instruction returns the node digest, so proof-relevant
code must compute it with VM instructions from the exact same tag and stack payload or ordered memory
chunk sequence.

Evaluation advice is also shape-dependent:

- `adv.evaluate_deferred` pushes the canonical tag and payload as advice. The tag is first in
  advice-pop order, so for a single 8-felt payload `adv_pushw adv_pushw adv_pushw` leaves
  `[PAYLOAD_LO, PAYLOAD_HI, TAG, ...]` on the operand stack.
- `adv.evaluate_deferred_tag` pushes only the canonical tag.
- `adv.evaluate_deferred_payload` pushes only the canonical payload:
  - data chunks use advice pop order `HIGH` then `LOW`, so `adv_pushw adv_pushw` leaves `LOW` above
    `HIGH` on the operand stack;
  - join payloads leave `lhs_digest` above `rhs_digest` after two `adv_pushw`s;
  - `TRUE` emits no payload advice.
- `TRUE` emits `Tag::TRUE` for tag-only/full evaluation.

All deferred-evaluation outputs, including tag-only output, are host hints. Before proof-relevant
use, code must relate them with VM instructions to values established independently of that advice.

### Random access memory

As mentioned above, there are two ways to access memory in Miden VM. The first way is via memory addresses using the instructions listed below. The addresses are absolute - i.e., they don't depend on the procedure context. Memory addresses can be in the range $[0, 2^{32})$.

Memory is guaranteed to be initialized to zeros. Thus, when reading from memory address which hasn't been written to previously, zero elements will be returned.

The second way to access memory is via procedure locals using the instructions listed below. These instructions are available only in procedure context. The number of locals available to a given procedure must be specified at [procedure declaration](./code_organization.md#procedures) time, and trying to access more locals than was declared will result in a compile-time error. A procedure can have at most $2^{16}$ locals, and the total number of locals available to all procedures at runtime is limited to $2^{31} - 1$. The assembler internally always rounds up the number of declared locals to the nearest multiple of 4.

> Accessing a memory local requires reading the frame memory pointer stored in memory, and hence incurs an extra memory read, as well as 2 stack-manipulating operations.

Unlike regular memory, procedure locals are not guaranteed to be initialized to zeros. Thus, when working with locals, one must assume that before a local memory address has been written to, it contains "garbage".

Internally in the VM, procedure locals are stored at memory offset starting at $2^{31}$. Thus, every procedure local has an absolute address in regular memory. The `locaddr.i` instruction is provided specifically to map an index of a procedure's local to an absolute address so that it can be passed to downstream procedures, when needed.

# Miden Core Library
Miden core library provides a set of procedures which can be used by any Miden program. These procedures build on the core instruction set of [Miden assembly](../assembly/index.md) expanding the functionality immediately available to the user.

The goals of Miden core library are:
* Provide highly-optimized and battle-tested implementations of commonly-used primitives.
* Reduce the amount of code that needs to be shared between parties for proving and verifying program execution.

The second goal can be achieved because calls to procedures in the core library can always be serialized as 32 bytes, regardless of how large the procedure is.

### Terms and notations
In this document we use the following terms and notations:

- A *field element* is an element in a prime field of size $p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$.
- A *binary* value means a field element which is either $0$ or $1$.
- Inequality comparisons are assumed to be performed on integer representations of field elements in the range $[0, p)$.

Throughout this document, we use lower-case letters to refer to individual field elements (e.g., $a$). Sometimes it is convenient to describe operations over groups of elements. For these purposes we define a *word* to be a group of four elements. We use upper-case letters to refer to words (e.g., $A$). To refer to individual elements within a word, we use numerical subscripts. For example, $a_0$ is the first element of word $A$, $b_3$ is the last element of word $B$, etc.

## Organization and usage
Procedures in the Miden Core Library are organized into modules, each targeting a narrow set of functionality. Modules are grouped under higher-level namespaces, e.g. `miden::core::math`. These higher-level namespaces are structured to not contain any items directly - instead, procedures and other items are defined in submodules of these high-level namespaces, e.g. `miden::core::math::u64` which provides useful 64-bit unsigned integer arithmetic procedures and constants.

For an example of how to invoke procedures from imported modules see [this section](../assembly/code_organization.md#importing-modules). Users should load `CoreLibrary` to access modules under the `miden::core` namespace. Core wrappers may use bundled precompile-backed verification internally, but users should rely on the stable `miden::core::*` facades.

## Available modules
Currently, Miden core library contains just a few modules, which are listed below. Over time, we plan to add many more modules which will include various cryptographic primitives, additional numeric data types and operations, and many others.

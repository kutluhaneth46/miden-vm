# Miden processor
This crate contains an implementation of Miden VM processor. The purpose of the processor is to execute a program and to generate a program execution trace. This trace is then used by Miden VM to generate a proof of correct execution of the program.

## Usage
The processor provides multiple APIs depending on your use case:

### High-level API
The `ProgramExecutor` trait provides a pluggable ordinary-execution interface returning
`ExecutionOutput`, with `FastProcessor` as its default implementation:

* `program: &Program` - a reference to a Miden program to be executed.
* `stack_inputs: StackInputs` - a set of public inputs with which to execute the program.
* `advice_inputs: AdviceInputs` - the private inputs used to build the advice provider with which to execute the program.
* `host: &mut impl Host` - an instance of a host which can be used to supply non-deterministic inputs to the VM and receive messages from the VM.
* `options: ExecutionOptions` - a set of options for executing the specified program (e.g., max allowed number of cycles).

The async trait method returns `Result<ExecutionOutput, ExecutionError>`, containing the final stack
state, advice provider, memory, and deferred state on success.

### Low-level API
For more control over execution and trace generation, you can use `FastProcessor` directly:

* `FastProcessor::execute()` - Executes a program without any trace generation overhead. Returns `ExecutionOutput` containing the final stack state and other execution results.
* `FastProcessor::execute_for_proving()` / `FastProcessor::execute_for_proving_sync()` -
  Executes a program while collecting the complete post-execution `ExecutionWitness`.
* `build_trace()` - Takes the `VmWitness` produced by `ExecutionWitness::into_parts()` and
  constructs the full `VmTrace`. When the `concurrent` feature is enabled, trace building is
  parallelized.
* `FastProcessor::execute_and_build_trace_sync()` - With the `std` feature, preserves the optimized
  synchronous path that overlaps execution with hasher trace construction and returns
  `(VmTrace, Option<PrecompileWitness>)`.

## Processor components
The processor is separated into two main components: **execution** and **trace generation**.

### Execution with `FastProcessor`
The `FastProcessor` is designed for fast program execution with minimal overhead. It can operate in two modes:

* **Pure execution** via `FastProcessor::execute()`: Executes a program without generating any trace-related metadata. This mode is optimized for maximum performance when proof generation is not required.
* **Witness-producing execution** via `FastProcessor::execute_for_proving()` /
  `FastProcessor::execute_for_proving_sync()`: Executes a program while collecting the complete
  post-execution `ExecutionWitness`.

### Trace generation with `build_trace()`
After execution with `FastProcessor::execute_for_proving*()`, split the returned
`ExecutionWitness` and pass its `VmWitness` to `build_trace()`. When the `concurrent` feature is
enabled, trace generation is parallelized for improved performance.


Trace generation produces the four matrices in the Miden proof statement:

* the core trace for the system, decoder, and operand stack;
* the stacked chiplets trace for the hash controller, bitwise, memory, ACE, and kernel ROM;
* the standalone 32-row Eidos compression trace; and
* the fixed And8 lookup trace, whose multiplicities also serve 16-bit range checks.

Typed LogUp relations connect requests and responses across these matrices. The processor collects
range-check and byte-lookup multiplicities while replaying execution and writes them into the fixed
And8 table; there is no separate range-checker execution-trace segment.

A much more in-depth description of Miden VM design is available [here](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-vm/design).

## Crate features
Miden processor can be compiled with the following features:

* `std` - enabled by default and relies on the Rust standard library.
* `concurrent` - enables concurrency across certain parts of execution
* `testing` - Enables APIs that can be helpful for testing
* `bus-debugger` - Used to debug our buses. Slows down the processor considerably.

To compile with `no_std`, disable default features via `--no-default-features` flag, in which case only the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasip1` targets are officially supported.
